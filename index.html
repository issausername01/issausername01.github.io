<p> This week I practiced organizing my text through the use of header tags. In doing this I hope that the text portion of my website can be dedicated as a changelog for ease of monitoring. I've also learned how to customize the font and color of the headers. However, I would like this page to ultimately serve my portfolio page time and effort withstanding. 
    Aesthetically I played around with adding gradient to my website using my favorite hues of turquoise blue. I'm not quite in love with it yet, but I hope to find a line of gradient code that strikes my particular interest.<p>
